I am interested in creating great systems that function efficiently, and I enjoy problem solving and working hard to find the best solution to a problem. It's easy for me to focus on problems while 
still being able to make time to communicate with team members and ensure the project is on track to meet its' goals. My experience as a lead programmer and systems developer with Half Dream Games 
on the video game Frag Tournament gave me valuable knowledge about the software development life cycle process and the challenges that come with it. I was responsible for communicating with the Product Owner 
for all major and minor design decisions. After creating the outline of the systems, and double checking it's feasibility with our supporting developers, I was responsible for implementing the system and 
ensuring its' functionality. The main language utilized was c++ along with Epic Games' open-source engine, Unreal Engine 4.5-5.3. this project included networked functionality via P2P connection through dedicated 
servers hosted by the players. I also have experience working at Activision Blizzard as a QA Game Tester on one of their flagship "Call Of Duty" games. During that time, I gained a lot of experience with Jira and wrote and 
published over 800 bugs. I was a team lead in 200+ people playtests and actively coordinated small group testing along with refining the backlog. I gained a lot of experience in team communication and management while 
working in a fast paced and intense environment.
